I wanna be part of this internship to learn how to actually code, 
not those basic assignments we do in school, actual code that can be used in real life
to implement real life instances.
In all the time i've spent in school, I've learned to escape coding, but now I just wanna learn how to do it for real,
although I have a few soft skills but learning how to program is gonna be a really big deal for me.
I've missed several opportunities because I cant code, I'd like to change that from now on
if you'll accept me
